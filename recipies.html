						<h1>Chunky and creamy potato salad</h1>
						<h4>by Deez Nuts</h4>
						<h3>Directions</h3>
						<p>
							1. Place the potatoes in a saucepan of lightly salted water, bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, and let cool.
							<br><br>
							2. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Snip the cooked bacon into pieces with a scissors, or chop.
							<br><br>
							3. In a large bowl, mix the mini potatoes, chopped bacon, hard-boiled eggs, broccoli, Cheddar cheese, ranch salad dressing, dill weed, salt, and pepper until thoroughly combined, and serve.
						</p>
						<h3>Ingredients</h3>
						<p>
							3 pounds yellow mini potatoes
							<br>
							12 slices bacon
							<br>
							5 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
							<br>
							1 cup chopped broccoli florets
