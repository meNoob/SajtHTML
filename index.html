						<h1>This website is dedicated to potato salads.</h1>
						<p>
							Intended for all ages, races and genders. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Potato salads have always had a deeper meaning behind them. When you look at a potato salad, you don't see just mashed or cut potatoes combined with leafs, salts and spices. You look at a potato salad and you see art, motivation. Hope. From the very beggining of time, every atom, every destruction and creation, every unkown force in nature that has created me and you. Everything lead to potato salad.
						</p>
						<p>
							On this website you will be able to find countless recipe of potato salads. From the expensive restaurant-style savory spanish potato salads to simple, yet exquisite in finesse, creamy potato salads.
